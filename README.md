# 📘 C++ Projects Repository

Welcome to my C++ Projects repository!  
This repo is a personal archive of all the C++ projects I've built as I learn the language—starting from beginner-level concepts to more intermediate-level problem-solving and system design.

## 🚀 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

- Reinforce concepts I learn while studying C++
- Track my learning progress over time
- Build a portfolio of projects that demonstrate my understanding
- Practice clean code, STL, OOP, and problem-solving

## 🧠 Topics Covered (as I learn)

- 🔹 Basics of C++ (Syntax, Loops, Conditionals)
- 🔹 Functions
- 🔹 File Handling
- 🔹 Multifile Compilation
- 🔹 Const Enum and Macro
